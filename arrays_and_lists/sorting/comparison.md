# COMPARISON BETWEEN SORTING ALGORITHMS

- Insertion Sort:
    time complexity:
        Best case (smaller and almost sorted list): O(n)
        Worst case (bigger and unsorted lists): O(n^2)
    space complexity:
        O(1)

- Merge sort:
    - for linked lists, this is the right choice.   
    time complexity:
        best and worst cases: O(n * log(n))
    space complexity:
        O(n)
